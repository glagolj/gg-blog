Lets further explore the weird world of the [2nd order roulette curves][my-article-1]. Or gear-in-hoop-in-wheel spirograph.


My previous slideshow of curves was aimed to be easier to reproduce with [wild gears][wild_gears_compact].
I tried to limit the choice of cogs to basic wild gear sets.
New [slideshow video][youtube-slideshow-2] expands the cogs and shows more of the crazy curves, but it will probably be harder to reproduce on paper.


Another interesting approach is to make a grid of outcomes.  Since
there are 10-20 available non-concentric hoops
there is a point to just keep adding different gears n3 and wheels n0 to the
same hoop (n1;n2). This makes a nice grid of (n0:n1;n2:n3) curves.


The first on display is the hoop (72;36) from [the most basic][wild_gears_compact] wild gears set (click on the image for large version):

To produce the image I run all combinations of gears and wheels and try to select for lighter curves (smaller T from the previous articles).
But not all hoop grids make interesting images. 
Boring ones are (108;25), (104;46), or (128;38) as most of the outcomes are "a messed up black blob" or "ropy" like ordinary hypotrochoids.
Clearly some commensurability is needed.
But not too much, as for instance, (64;32) grid is not much varied either.


A few interesting grids.  (84;36) hoop:

Or (105;40) hoop:


<a href="../../../../images/a002-grid-105_040-8x5-large.png"><img src="../../../../images/a002-grid-105_040-8x5-small.png" alt="Fig.3 grid of outcomes for (105;40) hoop"></a>


(126;56):


<a href="../../../../images/a002-grid-126_056-8x5-large.png"><img src="../../../../images/a002-grid-126_056-8x5-small.png" alt="Fig.3 grid of outcomes for (126;56) hoop"></a>


The selection criteria I used to organize grids seems to prefer more symmetric shapes to be displayed in this way.
There are always a lot of asymmetric curves (nsymm=1) when I search through parameters, but they don't end often on grids.
